		      <p>How might the shaping of technology make our lives more expressive and meaningful? What does it mean to design well — to design ethically? This presentation is a meditation on the design of everyday tools, toys, musical instruments, games, and social experiences. It is a story of how we shape technology -- and how technology, in turn, shapes us and our future.</p>

		    <h3>June 9th, 2022, 11:30am, Saint-Étienne Télécom</h3>
		    <p>In this keynote, Michel Buffa will tell you, and will show you -with the help of many live demonstrations-, the history of audio support on the Web platform. From Flash to HTML5, not forgetting aborted initiatives such as Mozilla's Audio Data API, you will see how the development of the W3C standards WebAudio, WebMidi, Web Assembly, Web Components (and a few others that are emerging at the moment, WebML, WebCodecs, etc.) has been able to transform the Web browser into a powerful tool for computer music. You'll also see that, as in the world of native applications, there are commercial digital audio workstations (DAWs), lots of open source applications, libraries, DSL programming languages that can compile and run in the browser, and that open source community standards for interoperable plugins exist and are trying to be adopted. You'll also see how the web platform stands out, often bringing a collaborative and instantaneous aspect that is more unusual in native applications. Indeed, we could not have predicted the huge shift to the online, web-based world that is now part of our daily lives after the COVID pandemic, but the expertise accumulated by WebAudio developers and academic researchers over the past decade makes the web today a perfectly placed platform to help shape how the music world continues to adapt to this new way of living and working.</p>

			<h3>June 11th, 2022, 11:00am, Saint-Étienne Télécom</h3>
			<p>If the first programming languages appeared in the 1950s, precursor formalisms existed long before the very first computers. We can mention in particular the Lambda Calculus of Alonzo Church in the ‘30s, or, even earlier, in the ‘20s, the Combinatory Logic of Moses Schonfinkel.</p>
			<p>One hundred years later, these proto-programming languages from before the very first computers are an extremely interesting source of inspiration for programming language designers. Some concepts, such as lambda (anonymous function) from Lambda Calculus, which were ignored for decades by the mainstream languages (with the exception of LISP), are now adopted by almost all modern programming languages.</p>
			<p>During this keynote, I will show how these formalisms directly inspired the design of FAUST, in particular how combinatory logic is at the root of its syntax, and how the notion of abstraction of Lambda Calculus plays a crucial role in its programming model.</p>
			<h3>Bio</h3>
			<p>Born in 1959 in France, Yann Orlarey is a composer, researcher, member of the Emeraude research team (INRIA, INSA, GRAME), and currently scientific director of <a href="https://www.grame.fr">GRAME</a>, the national center for musical creation based in Lyon, France. His musical repertoire includes instrumental, mixed, and interactive works as well as sound installations. His research work focuses in particular on programming languages for music and sound creation. He is the author or co-author of several musical software, including the programming language FAUST, specialized in acoustic signal synthesis and processing.</p>
