It will consist of three one day workshops by Michel Buffa, Ge Wang, and Yann Orlarey (see program below). The SMC-22 Summer School is free and targeted towards grad students in the cross-disciplinary fields of computer science, electrical engineering, music, and the arts in general. Attendance will be limited to 25 students. To apply to the SMC-22 Summer School, just <a href="https://forms.gle/HF2Xv7QtbZG5U4hE6">fill up this form</a> (you will be asked to provide a resume as well as a letter of intent). Applications will be reviewed "on the fly" on a "first come, first served basis:" if the profile of a candidate seems acceptable, it will be automatically selected.

		    <p>During this tutorial, you will first follow a WebAudio API presentation with examples and you will learn how to program simple effects or instruments with JavaScript. In a second part you will be introduced to "WebAudio Modules 2.0" (WAM), a standard for developing "VSTs on the Web." The new WAM ecosystem covers many use cases for developing plugins, from the amateur developer writing simple plugins using only JavaScript/HTML/CSS to the professional developer looking for maximum optimization, using multiple languages and compiling to WebAssembly. It was designed by people from the academic research world and by developers who are experts in Web Audio and have experience developing professional computer music applications. In its current state, the open source WAM 2.0 standard is still considered a "beta version," but in a stable state. The framework provides most of the best features found in native plugin standards, adapted to the Web. We regularly add new plugins to the wam-examples GitHub repository, but there are also dozens of WAMs developed by the community, such as the set of plugins created by the author of sequencer.party, who has open sourced them in their entirety. DUring this tutorial you will learn how to reuse existing plugins in a host web application, but also how to write your own reusable plugins using JavaScript, TypeScript or Faust.</p>

                      <p>In this workshop, participant will learn to work with <a href="https://chuck.stanford.edu/chunity/">Chunity</a> -- a programming environment for the creation of interactive audiovisual tools, instruments, games, and VR experiences. It embodies an audio-driven, sound-first approach that integrates audio programming and graphics programming in the same workflow, taking advantage of strongly-timed audio programming features of the ChucK audio programming language and the state-of-the-art real-time graphics engine found in Unity.</p>
		      <p>Through this one-day workshop, participants will learn:
			<ul>
			  <li>1) the fundamentals of Chunity workflow from ChucK to Unity,</li>
			  <li>2) how to architect audio-driven, strongly-timed software using Chunity,</li>
			  <li>3) design principles for interactive audiovisual/VR software</li>

                          <p>The objective of this one-day workshop is to discover the <a href="https://faust.grame.fr">Faust programming language</a> and its ecosystem and to learn how to program your own plugins or audio applications. No prior knowledge of Faust is required.</p>
			  <p>Faust is a functional programming language specifically designed for real-time signal processing and synthesis. It targets high-performance signal processing applications and audio plug-ins for a variety of platforms and standards. A distinctive feature of Faust is that it is not an interpreted, but a compiled language.  Thanks to the concept of architecture, Faust can be used to generate ready-to-use objects for a wide range of platforms and standards including audio plugins (VST, MAX, SC, PD, Csound,...), smartphone apps, web apps, embedded systems, etc.</p>
			  <p>At the end of the workshop, you will have acquired basic Faust programming skills and will be able to develop your own audio applications or plugins. You will also have a good overview of the main libraries available, of the documentation, and of the main programming tools that constitute the Faust ecosystem.</p>
