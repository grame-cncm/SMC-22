                <h1>How to Register?</h1>
                
                <p>Registration to SMC-22 will open at the end of Winter 2022. Stay tuned!</p>
                
                <h1>Registration Fees</h1>

		<p>Due to the hybrid format of the conference (both in-person and remote), we had to come up with a slightly more advanced registration fees chart compared to past editions of SMC. Additionally, we wanted to provide a lower registration cost for artists and make the conference completely free for people just "seating" at the conference (with no accepted paper or piece). The rule is fairly simple: if your name appears on one of the submissions (scientific or artistic) and you plan to attend the conference in person, then you will have to pay a registration fee. If your name appears on a paper submission and you will be attending the conference remotely, you will pay a reduced fee. If your name appears both on a paper and an artistic submission, you will have to pay the paper registration fee. If your name appears on multiple accepted submissions, you will have to pay the registration fee only once. Remote performances will only be accepted in special cases (network performances, etc.). In that case, artists attending the conference remotely will not have to pay a registration fee. Details are provided below:</p>

		<h1>Coming to SMC-22</h1>

		<h2>Where to Stay?</h2>

		<p>SMC-22 is partnering with various hotels in Saint-Étienne offering discounted rates for SMC-22 participants! Please, refer to <a href="misc/smcHotels.pdf">this document</a> if you would like to benefit from this special offer.</p>

		<p>Alternatively, AirBnb is always an option :).</p>

		<h2>Traveling to Saint-Étienne</h2>
		
		<p>Saint-Étienne (<a href="https://goo.gl/maps/RZPkm8R8nmyVmWRE6">https://goo.gl/maps/RZPkm8R8nmyVmWRE6</a>) is located about 65km South-West of Lyon, at the bottom of Massif Central mountain range. Here's an overview of how to get to Saint-Étienne.</p>

		<h3>By Train</h3>

		<p>The main train station in Saint-Étienne is <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/QePBJG37SgVuSabV9">Saint-Étienne Châteaucreux</a>. This station offers direct TGV (high speed train) service from <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/2hE9xXr1MxTfdMU46">Paris Gare de Lyon</a> (~2h30) and from <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/2bPCwm5ApizDXxgh6">Lyon Part Dieu</a> (~45mins). You plan to take the TGV, you should <a href="https://www.sncf-connect.com/en-en/">book your ticket in advance</a>.</p>

		<h3>By Plane</h3>

		<p>The closest airport to Saint-Étienne is <a href="https://g.page/lyonaeroport?share"> LYS - Lyon Saint-Exupéry</a> (1h drive). You can get to Saint-Étienne from LYS either by train, bus, or Taxi. By train, you wanna take the <a href="https://www.rhonexpress.fr/en_GB/?path=">RhôneXpress</a> to Lyon Part Dieu and then take a train to Saint-Étienne Châteaucreux from there (so LYS -> RhôneXpress -> Lyon Part Dieu -> Train -> Saint-Étienne Châteaucreux). By bus, you can take a direct <a href="https://global.flixbus.com/bus-routes/bus-lyon-saint-exupery-airport-saint-etienne">FlixBus from LYS to Châteaucreux</a>.</p>

		<p>If you are coming from outside of the EU, flying to Paris CDG is an option you should consider. Indeed, there are direct TGV (high speed) trains from CDG to Lyon Part Dieu and then you just have to change for a train to Saint-Étienne (there's usually one every 30 mins). So: CDG -> TGV -> Lyon Part Dieu -> Train -> Saint-Étienne Châteaucreux. We believe that this is the easiest option in many cases. If you choose this option, make sure to <a href="https://www.sncf-connect.com/en-en/">book your TGV ticket in advance</a>.</p>

		<h3>By Bus</h3>

		<p>Most major bus companies have direct bus lines to Saint-Étienne: <a href="https://www.flixbus.com/">FlixBus</a>, etc.</p>
